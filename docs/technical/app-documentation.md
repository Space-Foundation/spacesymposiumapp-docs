### Core Features

1. **User Authentication:** User Auth is handled outside the app, users register with launchsquid and receive a confirmation id which they use in conjunction with the user email to login.
2. **Database Operations:** Submits My Agenda items to a MySQL database and syncs user data with the app. Submits a token to AWS RDS Postgres to register for push notifications.
3. **Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging supports sending push notifications to users.
4. **Analytics:** Google Analytics data to understand user behavior and improve the app.

### UI/UX Features

1. **Vector Icons:** App includes customizable vector icons for enhanced UI design.
2. **Device Information:** Integration with `react-native-device-info` for accessing device information used for analytics or feature customization based on the device.
3. **Environment Configuration:** Use of `react-native-dotenv` for managing environment variables for configuring different environments (development, staging, production).
4. **Dropdown Picker:** Incorporation of `react-native-dropdown-picker` for dropdown menus in the app's UI.
5. **UI Toolkit:** Use of `react-native-elements` for additional UI components and theming.

### Development and Debugging Tools
