As we look forward to the Space Symposium 40 next year, we're excited to share some fantastic updates and new features coming to the Space Symposium App. This year's event will be a blast, and we're committed to making your experience even better next time around. Let's dive into what's new and what you can expect from the next iteration of our app.

## New Features on the Horizon

### 1. **Purchase Dinner Tickets Directly from the App**

Gone are the days of navigating through multiple websites to secure your dinner tickets. For Space Symposium 40, you'll be able to purchase dinner tickets directly within the app. This seamless integration means less hassle for you and more time enjoying the event.

### 2. **Geo-fencing for Enhanced Location Notifications**

We're introducing geo-fencing technology to send you location-based notifications. Whether it's a reminder about an upcoming session or alerts about activities happening near you, this feature ensures you won't miss out on anything important.

### 3. **Networking: In-App Messaging and Chat**

Networking is a key part of the Space Symposium experience. With the new in-app messaging and chat feature, connecting with fellow attendees has never been easier. Whether you're looking to share insights, coordinate meetups, or simply make new friends, our app has got you covered.

### 4. **Lead Capture for Exhibitors**

For our exhibitors, we're rolling out a lead capture feature to help you connect with potential clients more efficiently. This tool will allow you to gather information from attendees interested in your products or services, streamlining the follow-up process.

## Behind the Scenes: Development Sneak Peek

The app development team, led by Crystal McNeil, is hard at work implementing these new features. We're leveraging the latest technologies and best practices to ensure the app is not only feature-rich but also user-friendly and reliable.

- **React Native and TypeScript** remain our core technologies, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and robust type-checking.
- **Geo-fencing** will be implemented using location services and background processing to provide timely and relevant notifications without draining your battery.
